# Lets-Twist
Ergonomic split mechanical keyboard

I'm an [Ergodox keyboard](https://www.ergodox.io/) user. Even if I'm really happy with it, there's room for improvement. *Let's Twist !* is an attempt to gather every brilliant idea I've seen on other Ergonomic split keyboards.

First of all, I want to keep some of the Ergodox features :

Then, like a lot of people, I find that the thumb clusters of the Ergodox are too far away from the alphas. I saw Mikel Duffy's great [modified Ergodox](https://medium.com/@mikelduffy/hand-wiring-a-modified-ergodox-1adbfc479468), and I want the two thumb main keys to be in the same position.

My project was heavily inspired by Mattia Dal Ben's [Redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard). It's really a stunning project. Like him, I want my keyboard to have a reduced size, and to be able to plug either half (or just one of them) to the PC.
