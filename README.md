# Let's Twist !
## Ergonomic split mechanical keyboard

I'm an [Ergodox keyboard](https://www.ergodox.io/) user. Even if I'm really happy with it, there's room for improvement. *Let's Twist !* is an attempt to gather every brilliant idea I've seen on other ergonomic split keyboards.

First of all, I want to keep some of the Ergodox features :
- the thumb clusters, because it's a great way to lighten the work of the other fingers.
- the columnar staggered arrangement of the keys, because it's way more natural than the traditional row staggered layout.
- the split design, because it allows you to have a very comfortable position.
- programmable with QMK, I don't think I need to explain whyâ€¦
- 1.5u wide keys on the outer columns, because it's aesthetically pleasing ! 

Then, like a lot of people, I find that the thumb clusters of the Ergodox are too far away from the alphas. I saw Mikel Duffy's great [modified Ergodox](https://medium.com/@mikelduffy/hand-wiring-a-modified-ergodox-1adbfc479468), and I want the two main thumb keys to be in the same position.

My project was heavily inspired by Mattia Dal Ben's [Redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard). It's really a stunning project. Like him, I want my keyboard to have a reduced size, and to be able to plug either half (or just one of them) to the PC. 


So, here is the layout I get :

The PCB can manage 2 or 3 keys for each of the thumb clusters. The blue keys can be 1u or 1.25u.
